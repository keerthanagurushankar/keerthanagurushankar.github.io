Things I like about living in the US:
- The freedom to untie my hair, wear shorts, eat meat and be with whomever I please
- Long empty sidewalks to run for miles and miles, even trails
- Thrift stores abundant with beautiful cheap things
- Probably milder workplace politics than what I've been told about various other places

Things I like about CMU:
- In 11th grade, I attended a 2 day math camp before the INMO. I thought it would be a dream to do that everyday.
- In 12th grade, I loved OCW and thought it would be surreal to be a part of those live lectures.
- Today these things are largely the realities of my life.
