<ul>
  <li>The freedom to untie my hair, wear shorts, eat meat and be with whomever I please</li>
  <li>Long empty sidewalks to run for miles and miles, even trails</li>
  <li>Thrift stores abundant with beautiful cheap things</li>
  <li>Probably milder workplace politics than what I’ve been told about various other places</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I like about CMU:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In 11th grade, I attended a 2 day math camp before the INMO. I thought it would be a dream to do that everyday.</li>
  <li>In 12th grade, I loved OCW and thought it would be surreal to be a part of those live lectures.</li>
  <li>Today these things are largely the realities of my life.</li>

Like everyone else stuck at home during COVID, I tried Couch to 5K—it was a whole trend, right? People were running in their neighborhoods because what else were you going to do.</p>

<p>[opening paragraph about early attempts - to be filled in]</p>

<p>Fast forward to now—it’s 2025, I run 30 miles a week and genuinely look forward to it, and I broke a two-year bench press plateau going from 50 to 90 pounds. I still can’t quite believe I’m someone who does this voluntarily, but here we are.</p>

<p>Five years ago, my relationship with exercise was “not fun, not consistent.” Now I run 30 miles a week, I’m breaking PRs on my lifts, and I actually look forward to workouts. I still can’t quite believe that’s true.</p>
