## About Me

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/). My current research focuses on AI Algorithm design for socio-technical systems. 

In the past, I was a math undergrad, also at CMU! I really like research breadth and exploration. In the past, I have done some research in Information Theory, Neuroscience and Programming Languages.
