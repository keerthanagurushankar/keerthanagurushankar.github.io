## About Me

I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/). I use data-driven approaches to study human evaluation systems, especially peer review.

In the past, I was a math undergrad, also at CMU! I did some research in Information Theory, Neuroscience and recently dabbled in Programming Languages.
